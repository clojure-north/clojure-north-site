Clojure's multimethods are its most powerful and flexible tool for creating abstractions. But the Common Lisp Object System's (CLOS) multimethods offer even more power.

[Methodical](https://github.com/camsaul/methodical) is a new library that provides drop-in replacements for Clojure multimethods and adds several advanced features. In this talk Cam will give a brief overview of what some of those features are, how he ported them to Clojure and how you can use Methodical to solve real-world problems and write clearer, more concise code.
