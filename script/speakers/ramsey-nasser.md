Game development is traditionally done in object oriented languages with pervasive mutation, so how does a functional lisp like Clojure work in the same setting? The Arcadia project integrates Clojure into Unity, the industry standard game engine, to do just that. This talk will dissect a few games made in Arcadia to explore how we use Clojure's strengths to make game development radically different.

Through Ramsey's talk you'll see concrete examples of how to use Clojure's functional semantics and lisp idioms in a game development context.
