Anatoly would like to introduce you to this new, 60 year old, kid on the block: "Machine Learning". Some math + some stats, but mostly "what"s, "why"s and "how"s of different problems it solves, and of course some code, since that's what machines speak best.

While we'll ride along with mouthfuls such as "stochastic gradient descent", "cross entropy" and friends, the focus will mostly be on people, data and code, since those are the main ingredients.

After this talk you won't be able to architect The Matrix yet, but you shall be able to see "The Woman in the Red Dress" and go home to build some WALL-Es and Johnny 5s. All this will of course be possible with a certain probability between 0 and 1.

He went from "[ZX Spectrum The Great](https://www.dotkam.com/2008/11/19/zx-spectrum-child/)" to IBM z/Series and then back to human oriented hardware. He works at [Chariot Solutions](https://chariotsolutions.com/) where he has an opportunity to hack on Clojure, Java, Scala, Go, mobile and this thing people call big data. In his free time he drinks scotch, smokes hookah, jams some guitar chords with others, and then some.
