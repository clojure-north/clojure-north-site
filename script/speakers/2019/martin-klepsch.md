Documentation is a key part of working with open source libraries. Good documentation makes programmers more productive. It's what makes simple things easy.

In this talk we will discuss cljdoc, a website that provides API docs and more advanced documentation tooling for the Clojure community.

### About Martin

Martin is a Clojure/Script consultant who never expected to work on a documentation platform. Before starting cljdoc he helped run various community events in Berlin, created CLJSJS and contributed to lots of Clojure OpenSource projects like Boot, the ClojureScript compiler, re-frame and more. He’s also organising a conference in Europe beginning of August next year, called Heart Of Clojure.
