In 2016's Spec-ulation keynote Rich Hickey presented the idea that we can evolve our software through accretion instead of changing. Wilker adopted this idea as the foundation of his work on libraries like Pathom.  In this talk he'd like to share the things learned during this time around evolving code avoiding, like using open maps to allow new things on functions, creating new functions instead of changing current ones, using long keyword names to avoid ambiguity, and so on. Join us as Wilker shares the lessons he's learned along the way.
