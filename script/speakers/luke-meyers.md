This talk is about a new tool to analyze noisy data and data in general to make sense of it. The tool itself borrows methods from the field of algebraic topology (and apparently other pure math fields)  to understand the data through formalizing the concept of shape.

Will start off talking about basic concepts and how it relates to shape and an example of it's usage to image analysis (most likely the MNIST data set)

### About Luke

Luke likes playing around with math in hopes of understanding reality and bending reality to my will.
