Like Clojure, TLA+ can enhance your mind, making you understand your systems better and giving you a way to, in a high abstract level, run your ideas (specifications). 

Of course they are not free to deal with, you still have to learn a new language (it's not a programming language, thought it has parts of it) and think about your system in a mathematical way. 

There are a lot of resources appearing in the last years and this talk proposes to show you a initial path to TLA+ specifiactions and how to hack it with Clojure, hope you enjoy o/
