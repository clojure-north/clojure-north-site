So you love immutability and want to time-travel your data. But then what happens when the data grows in size and you're integrating it from various upstream sources? What value of time do you want time-travel against?

What do you do when data occasionally arrives out of order in a global topology, or if you want to make corrections against the past?

What if we've so much data, that we want to start compacting it? What if some of that data is personal data and we need to get rid of it whilst preserving an immutable record?

Jon will unveil a new bi-temporal databased called Crux that addresses these concerns. During this talk Jon will explain the motivation for building Crux and will highlight some of its upcoming features, including - but not limited to - bitemporality.
