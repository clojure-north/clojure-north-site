 :title "Solving Problems the Clojure Way"}

Solving Problems the Clojure Way is a look at what "functional programming" and "data-driven programming" mean, with examples (ex. re-frame's declarative events; pedestal routes; generating db functions, APIs from schemas).

Rafal features a demo in this talk of working through a sample problem in an imperative way, vs functional way, vs. data-driven way).

Targeted mostly at new, learning Clojurists, and non-Clojurists alike.
