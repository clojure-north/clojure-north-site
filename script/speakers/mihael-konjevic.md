Keechma is a frontend ClojureScript framework based on Reagent. In this talk Mihael covers the architectural differences from other frameworks and how Keechma enables him to deliver polished UI experiences to his customers.

Most of the talk will focus on the Keechma controllers and route driven apps. Mihael will show how he uses them to implement state driven animations, data loading, forms and animated route transitions.
