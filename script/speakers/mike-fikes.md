The ESP32 chip, positioned roughly between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi, can be made to run ClojureScript. This opens up exciting new capabilities that previously weren't available.

This talk will cover why you might want to run ClojureScript on these devices and what new problems this helps you solve. 

Mike will cover how you do this using Espruino embedded JavaScript engine, covering recently-developed tooling in this area.

Mike will give insight into REPL-driven development, producing optimal release builds for this platform, and hardware considerations surrounding building solutions.
