In this talk James delvers into arcane Clojure debugging, where you need to fix someone else's code. We explore case studies of some particularly nasty situations, highlighting how Clojure's dynamic nature makes some very ugly debugging situations surprisingly tractable.

### About James

James Cash loves building things and is always trying to figure out how to build things better. He loves learning new programming languages and when Clojure came out it quickly became one of his favourites.

James works in Toronto with Rafal Dittwald to build what needs to be built and teaches web & iOS programming on the side.
