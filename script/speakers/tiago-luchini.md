Resiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. It is not about avoiding failures but accepting the fact that failures will happen and responding to them in a way that avoids downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state after a failure.

Building resilient systems requires inculcating a strong sense of acceptance of failures to the team since day very first day of a project. The team will need to create solutions to make sure that the system either recovers from failures or that it still functions despite ongoing failures.

Some of these potential failures may involve lost computing or data nodes, inaccessible clusters, network losses, among many other. Sometimes there are ripple effects due to natural latency of the involved dependencies.

In this Tiago explores a design approach that accepts and embraces failures from the outset and leads to much better and more resilient applications. In the end you will learn how to create more reliable and fault-tolerant systems.
